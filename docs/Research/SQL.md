# SQL Research

## General

Source: [MySQL Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S_tz1z_5bA)

### Install

[MySQL Community Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

### MySQL Workbench Tips

- Data can be entered/altered by typing directly into a table (no query).
- Click the wrench next to a table to view it in design mode. This allows for manipulation of primary key, nullables, so on.

### Creating Databases

- Databases are, themselves, created with and populated by SQL queries: CREATE DATABASE, CREATE TABLE, INSERT INTO, among others.

### Database Objects

- Tables
- Views: combine data from multiple tables
- Stored Procedures: a bit like saved queries
- Functions: a bit like saved queries

### The SELECT Statement

SELECT columns FROM table;

- Additional clauses can be included to make the statement more expressive.
- Two hyphens (--) is the syntax to begin a comment.
- An asterisk (\*) in the SELECT clause will grab all columns.
- Individually named columns are separated by comma.
- Arithmetic expressions can be included in SELECT clause.
- Can give aliases using AS keyword.
- DISTINCT keyword will omit duplicates.
- LIMIT clause will limit the number of records from a query. If the limit is not reached, all will be returned.
- Limits can include an offset as \<LIMIT 6,3\>, which skips the first six records before returning three.

### The WHERE Clause

SELECT columns FROM table WHERE conditions;

- A filter for gathering data.
- \>, \>=, \<, \<=, \=, \!= or \<> are the syntax for relational operators.
- Date comparisons supported, write them in format 'YYYY-MM-DD'.
- AND, OR, NOT are included as keywords.
- AND is always evaluated first, followed in precedence by OR then NOT.
- To use the IN operator, follow it with a list of values enclosed in parentheses.
- To use the BETWEEN operator, follow it with AND-separated bounds (they are inclusive).
- The LIKE operator is used to pattern match strings. For example, consider \<WHERE last_name LIKE b%\>, this would filter strings starting with b.
- In string patterns, the \% represents any number of characters and the \_ represents only one.
- The REGEXP (regular expression) operator can represent more complex string patterns: \^ is begins with, \$ is ends with, \| is or, \[\] specify characters, \- is range.
- IS NULL can be used to search for records with missing values.

### The ORDER BY Clause

SELECT columns FROM table ORDER BY columns;

- Statement can by followed by ASC or DESC to specify the order.
- Each column in the ORDER BY can be sorted differently.
- Data can be sorted by an alias.

### Inner JOINs

SELECT columns FROM table JOIN table ON conditions;

- Ambiguous columns, those that exist in either table, must be prefixed with the name of their table.
- Table names aliased by first letter, as convention.
- You can join across multiple databases by adding an extra layer to the dot operator chain (e.g., database.table.column).
- Tables can be joined with themselves, but each instance must be given a different alias. Otherwise the syntax is about the same.
- JOINs can be chained to join several tables at the same time, this is common.
- Compound conditions can be used to represent composite primary keys, among other things. These are made as typical compound boolean statements.
- Implicit join syntax allows for omitting JOIN in lieu of commas. Avoid this, it's dangerous.
- Natural JOINs are done without specifying column names, common columns are used. Once again, this is dangerous.

### Outer JOINs

SELECT columns FROM table LEFT/RIGHT JOIN table ON conditions;

- In SQL, there are LEFT and RIGHT JOINs.
- LEFT JOIN will return all records from the left table, regardless of the condition.
- RIGHT JOIN will return all records from the right table, regardless of the condition.
- Only the speficied unmatched records will be returned. That is, in a LEFT JOIN, unmatched records in the right table won't be returned.
- Outer joins can still be chained for several tables. In these chains, outer and inner joins can be mixed.
- As a best practice, avoid using right joins. Keeping the direction consistent will make code more readable.
- Outer joins can also be done on self.

### The USING Clause

SELECT columns FROM table JOIN table USING (columns);

- USING is syntax for the simplification of join conditions.
- It does the same job as an equality comparison between columns of different tables.
- Columns must have the same name in either table for it to work.

### Cross JOINs

SELECT columns FROM table CROSS JOIN table;

- Every record from one table joins every record from another.
- There are no conditions.
- This is sometimes referred to as the cartesian product between tables. It can be used to yield all possible combinations.
- Again, implicit syntax can be used here.

### UNIONs

query UNION query

- Combine data from multiple queries by row.
- The quieries involved don't have to be against the same table.

## Creating Databases and Tables

### Database

Example

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mainline
```

### Table

Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE moneylines (
  moneyline INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  odds SMALLINT NOT NULL,
  contestant VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  sportsbook VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (moneyline),
  FOREIGN KEY (contestant) REFERENCES contestants(contestant),
  FOREIGN KEY (sportsbook) REFERENCES sportsbooks(sportsbook)
)
```

## bit.io

### Getting Started

- Fast and easy way to set up a PostgreSQL database.
- Compatible with Node.js (or any tool that uses Postgres)!
- Sign-up required, but free.
- Database can be made public or shared with other users.
- Free databases are limited to 3GB, this shouldn't be an issue for us.
- Data can be uploaded from a CSV file.
- Markdown documentation can be added to database tables.
- Query results are downloadable.
- Credentials needed for connecting to a SQL client are in the "Connect" menu on the database page.
- Using an API key, the password from "Connect" menu, a POST request can query any database table you have access to.

### Connecting with VS Code

- Install the PostgreSQL extension.
- Add new connection from SQLTools, select PostgreSQL.
- All details needed are in database "Connect" menu.
- SSL must be enabled.
- Once complete, you can write and execute queries from a .sql file.

### PostgreSQL Syntax

Much of this document describes SQL per MySQL syntax. PostgreSQL is different, if only slightly. See the following guide: [PostgreSQL Crash Course](https://docs.bit.io/docs/sql-crash-course).

### Querying from Node.js

I'll save the in-depth research on this for later. In the meantime, see [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/).

## Amazon RDS

### Comment
The Amazon RDS documentation is very hard to follow. As you'll see, the section below is pretty esoteric. This is one reason I'm leaning toward bit.io for
database hosting, it should be suitable for one as small as ours.

### Creating and connecting to a MySQL DB instance

- There are "Easy create" and "Standard create" options. Easy uses defaults, standard allows more configuration options (including making a public DB).
- As prerequisites, one must sign up for an AWS account and create an admin user.
- Create a MySQL DB instance in the AWS Management Console.
- Create an EC2 instance in the same VPC as the DB instance.
- Connect EC2 and MySQL DB instance automatically.
- Connect to the MySQL DB instance from a client.

## Addendum

### Topics for Further Research

- None for now!
